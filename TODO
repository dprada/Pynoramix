- Check the displacement vector and the involvent coefficient (ENM)
- Think about the concept 'parent'
- Make two different functions: make_selection (mirror) and make_set_from_selection (no mirror)
- Add the posibility to create a new molecule (hard copy, not a pointer) with selection. 
- Use pickle to save the normal modes analysis.
- The function to build the enm movie needs to check if the file exists.
- To select the hydrogens: (HW1 and HW2) or there is another option (H?, H*?)
- The function neighbs should include the option 'frame'.
- Case to study: The system named A has a selection name sub_A. If the coordinates of A have changed (i.e.: new frames attached or a rotation of A)... the coordinates of sub_A are updated?
- Case to sudy: The neighbors belonging to selection sub_B of the selection sub_A are computed. The indexes of atoms neighbors[0] are internal indexes of sub_B. Is it right?
- Write trajs

0        b(sin(gama))        c(cos(alpha) - cos(beta) cos(gama) / sin(gama)
0        0                   V/(ab sin(gama))

where V = abc(1 - (cos(alpha))^2 - (cos(beta))^2 - (cos(gama))^2+
2cos(alpha) cos(beta) cos(gama))^1/2

- Fix the problem of box/cell to include the angles. When the frame is handed and when the traj is writted.
