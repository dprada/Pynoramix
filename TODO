- Check the displacement vector and the involvent coefficient (ENM)
- Think about the concept 'parent'
- Make two different functions: make_selection (mirror) and make_set_from_selection (no mirror)
- Add the posibility to create a new molecule (hard copy, not a pointer) with selection. 
- Use pickle to save the normal modes analysis.
- The function to build the enm movie needs to check if the file exists.
- To select the hydrogens: (HW1 and HW2) or there is another option (H?, H*?)
- The function neighbs should include the option 'frame'.
- Case to study: The system named A has a selection name sub_A. If the coordinates of A have changed (i.e.: new frames attached or a rotation of A)... the coordinates of sub_A are updated?
- Case to sudy: The neighbors belonging to selection sub_B of the selection sub_A are computed. The indexes of atoms neighbors[0] are internal indexes of sub_B. Is it right?

- ##### Not orthorhombic cells to be corrected: #########

It is not very efficient, the functions are checking if the box is cubic (example distance). 
In addition the reading and writting checks every frame if is cubic.
The PBC function does not work for not cubic boxes.

-selection 'within x of' should work for any list of frames not only for "ALL". In addition, it is not efficient when reload_frame is used a lot.
Making selections is computationally expensive. It is not the distance.. or the within... the problem is making the selection all the time.

- RDF: Right now the function does not work properly if setA=setB. In
  addition, this should be efficient including the condition "same
  set" for function dists.

- The MCL function has now the option pruning. In this case the external program mcl is called. Implementing this pruning in my function it is necessary.

- Test the different possibilities of verlet lists and grid search. Implement and test the update verlet lists per cells.

- Remove the virtual atoms from verlet lists and grid search. The usually do not participate from any analysis.
